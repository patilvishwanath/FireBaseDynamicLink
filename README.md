# FireBaseDynamicLink
Firebase Dynamic Links are links that work the way you want, on multiple platforms, and whether or not your app is already installed.

With Dynamic Links, your users get the best available experience for the platform they open your link on. 
If a user opens a Dynamic Link on iOS or Android, they can be taken directly to the linked content in your native app
